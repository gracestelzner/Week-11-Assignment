# Week-11-Assignment
In this code I uploaded a series of my favorite desserts. The Rating variable is my rating of each dessert on a scale of 1-10, 1 being the lowest and 10 being the highest. The Bites variable is how many bites of each dessert I could eat comfortably without getting sick. Each dessert has a number for rating and a bites. 

The graph in the code is a scatter plot of each rating on the x axis and bite number on the y axis with the desserts all having different shapes for their respective points on the graph.
